      <section>
        <h3 class="jobheader"><p class="jobtitle">Habitat | Solo passion project</p><p class="daterange">April 2022 - Present</p></h3>
        <p>Habitat is an incomplete SSB client written in C++ for the Haiku operating system. It currently uses the BeOS API plus Haiku's GUI layout extensions, libsodium, and I am currently in the process of porting its data storage from BFS indices to SQLite 3. This is usually just a spare time project but I've had a couple of periods of working on it full time recently, and have been also using it as an opportunity to experiment with approaches to time management and gain a clearer idea of what works for me and what doesn't.</p>
