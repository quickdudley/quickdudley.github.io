      <h2>Manyverse (Scuttlebutt)</h2>
      <p>
      This is the least straightforward to get started with but is easy enough
      to use once it's up and running and is currently my main form of social
      media. It provides similar functions to Facebook but without video.
      </p>
      <p>
      Scuttlebutt is decentralised to a greater degree than the other entries
      on this page: there are types of server that exist but users can also
      exchange posts and messages directly by being on the same WiFi network.
      The instructions below will connect you to a room server, which we will be
      using as a simple relay.
      </p>
      <p>This procedure assumes we already know each other.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Step 1: Install <a href="https://manyver.se">Manyverse</a> on your phone or computer.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Open your own profile, click the grey code, select either &quot;Copy SSB URI&quot; or &quot;Copy cypherlink&quot;, and send the SSB URI or cypherlink to me via whatever channel we already use to communicate.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Arrange a time with me for the initial syncrhonization</li>
        <li>Step 4: At the agreed upon time use the web browser on the same device as Manyverse to open <a href="https://jeremylist.scuttle.space">jeremylist.scutttle.space</a>, let the page redirect to Manyverse, and follow the profile that opens. If it says I'm offline then go back to the web browser and click the &quot;Connect with jeremylist&quot; button again. Once the connection has succeeded once it will happen again automatically.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="matrix">
      <h2>Element (Matrix)</h2>
      <p>
      Matrix and the remaining entries on this page are examples of federated
      systems. This means users connect to servers and user accounts are tied
      to the servers on which they were created, but users who have chosen
      different servers are still able to communicate.
      </p>
      <p>Matrix is a federated instant messaging system, and Element is an
      application that can connect to Matrix.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Step 1: Install <a href="https://element.io">Element</a></li>
        <li>Step 2: Go through the account setup procedure</li>
        <li>Step 3: Type <code>@j_p_list:matrix.org</code> into the search bar</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="mastodon">
      <h2>Mastodon</h2>
      <p>Mastodon is a federated microblogging network which can be considered a replacement for Twitter.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Step 1: Pick a server and create an account. <a href="https://instances.social">instances.social</a> can help you choose one.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Search for my account <code>@jeremy_list@toot.party</code></li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="pixelfed">
      <h2>Pixelfed</h2>
      <p>Pixelfed is a federated image sharing network which can be considered a replacement for Instagram.</p>
      <p>The procedure is almost the same as for <a href="#mastodon">Mastodon</a> with these differences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The list of instances is at <a href="https://fedidb.org/software/pixelfed">https://fedidb.org/software/pixelfed</a></li>
        <li>My profile is <a href="https://pixelfed.nz/jeremy_list"><code>@jeremy_list@pixelfed.nz</code></a>.</li>
