      <h2>Manyverse (Scuttlebutt)</h2>
      <p>
      This is the least straightforward to get started with but is easy enough
      to use once it's up and running and is currently my main form of social
      media. It provides similar functions to Facebook although without video
      support.
      </p>
      <p>
      Scuttlebutt is decentralised to a greater degree than the other entries
      on this page: there are types of server that exist but users can also
      exchange posts and messages directly by being on the same WiFi network.
      </p>
      <p>This procedure assumes we already know each other and that you don't
      already have Manyverse up and running.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Step 1: Install <a href="https://manyver.se">Manyverse</a> on your phone or computer.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Open your own profile, click the grey code, select either &quot;Copy SSB URI&quot; or &quot;Copy cypherlink&quot;, and send the SSB URI or cypherlink to me via whatever channel we already use to communicate. See also: step 4.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Click or tap <a href="ssb://experimental/?action=consume-alias&alias=jeremylist&multiserverAddress=net%3Ascuttle.space%3A8008~shs%3APDNB49%2FfouC6ojcoCqOWou9zNOBfulpQEhf1WU0fMz0%3D&roomId=%40PDNB49%2FfouC6ojcoCqOWou9zNOBfulpQEhf1WU0fMz0%3D.ed25519&signature=HvTfAs3F2yJ5807LtoEhi98pkSXBnnGCjt0psWqlF8ogkE6dFKnHGOHFp7NhdYpDzSuw00LKuWWtLhWrHbeyCg%3D%3D&userId=%400W1ekqmNIN4e1IsAWBM1Kft6w5w86BMUdPO2M0SO83I%3D.ed25519">this link</a>. A placeholder for my profile will open in Manyverse: you will need to follow it in order to load any of my posts.</li>
        <li>Step 4: Use the link from step 3 again; this step will only succeed if I also have Manyverse open at that moment so you may need to try more than once and/or arrange a time with me to do it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      The link in step 3 allows Manyverse to both connect to a relay server
      (called a room server) and connect through that room server to my copy of
      Manyverse. Some of the information that will be exchanged is additional
      means of connecting to the Scuttlebutt network (which can be activated
      through the entries on the Connections panel).
      </p>
      <p>
      If you don't need the above procedure for the initial connection the
      following is a link to my profile without the embedded relay server details:

    <section id="matrix">
      <h2>Element (Matrix)</h2>
      <p>
      Matrix and the remaining entries on this page are examples of federated
      systems. This means users connect to servers and user accounts are tied
      to the servers on which they were created, but users who have chosen
      different servers are still able to communicate.
      </p>
      <p>Matrix is a federated instant messaging system, and Element is an
      application that can connect to Matrix.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Step 1: Install <a href="https://element.io">Element</a></li>
        <li>Step 2: Go through the account setup procedure</li>
        <li>Step 3: Type <code>@j_p_list:matrix.org</code> into the search bar</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="mastodon">
      <h2>Mastodon</h2>
      <p>Mastodon is a federated microblogging network which can be considered a replacement for Twitter.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Step 1: Pick a server and create an account. <a href="https://instances.social">instances.social</a> can help you choose one.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Search for my account <code>@jeremy_list@toot.party</code></li>
      </ul>

    <section id="pixelfed">
      <h2>Pixelfed</h2>
      <p>Pixelfed is a federated image sharing network which can be considered a replacement for Instagram.</p>
      <p>The procedure is almost the same as for <a href="#mastodon">Mastodon</a> with these differences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The list of instances is at <a href="https://fedidb.org/software/pixelfed">https://fedidb.org/software/pixelfed</a></li>
        <li>My profile is <a href="https://pixelfed.nz/jeremy_list"><code>@jeremy_list@pixelfed.nz</code></a>.</li>
